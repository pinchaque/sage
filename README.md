# sage
Sage is a C++ framework for the game of chess that supports different AI
player profiles. The goal is to allow for machine learning of chess 
tactics through the use of evolutionary algorithms and temporal 
difference learning by having different AI profiles compete against
one another. 

The code is currently in a pre-alpha state and is provided as an example
of my C++ coding. The game engine and move policy framework is complete.
